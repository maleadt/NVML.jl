# ~NVML.jl~: DEPRECATED, use [CUDA.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGPU/CUDA.jl) instead!

This package wraps the [NVIDIA Management Library
API](http://docs.nvidia.com/deploy/nvml-api/), a programmatic interface for monitoring and
managing various states within NVIDIA GPUs. It is intended to be a platform for building 3rd
party applications, and is also the underlying library for the NVIDIA-supported `nvidia-smi`
tool.
